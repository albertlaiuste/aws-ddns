# Dynamic DNS with Docker and AWS Route 53

This project sets up a dynamic DNS service using Docker, AWS Route 53, and AWS CLI. The service periodically checks for any changes to your current IP address and if it detects one then it updates your DNS record with your current IP address using the AWS CLI.
